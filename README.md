Target: label (income >50K or <=50K)
Methods Used
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Steps

Load and preprocess the dataset (handle categorical features using one-hot encoding).
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate different classification models.
Compare performance using training and testing accuracy.
Visualize KNN performance for different k values.
